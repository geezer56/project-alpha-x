       <p class="paragraph">Aspen Grove is the kind of place that immediately makes you forget where you came from and makes you want to put down aspen-like roots and never leave.  Your sojourn temporarily ends here but your adventures are just beginning. <br><br>
       But first things first.  Enjoy your morning cup while you listen to everyone's favorite Acapella group, your local Colorado songbirds. Or mingle with the locals and take a casual early morning stroll down to one of our favorite Frisco coffee shops! </p>
