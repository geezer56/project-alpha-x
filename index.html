        <h3>Summit County Sanctuary</h3>
    
       <p>Aspen Grove is the kind of place that immediately makes you forget where you came from and makes you want to put down aspen-like roots and never leave.  Your sojourn temporarily ends here but your adventures are just beginning. </p>
      <p> But first things first.  Enjoy your morning cup while you listen to everyone's favorite Acapella group, your native Colorado songbirds. Or mingle with the locals and take a casual early morning stroll down to one of our favorite Frisco coffee shops! </p>

    <p>But don't let the tranquil setting lull you into a false sense of isolation!  You are well positioned to take advantage of all exciting recreational and cultural opportunities that Frisco and Summit County have to offer!  The shops and restaurants of Main street are a short 4 minute walk. There you will also find bustops for the County wide FREE Summit Stage bus service.  The Frisco Marina and Frisco Adventure Park are ealy accessible by bike and Copper Mountain is 6 miles west on I-70.<br> For more information on what's happening in Frisco go to <br>
